# FlyRank Capstone — Embeddable Widget & Lead-Capture Platform

> Let a customer define a widget, hand them one line of `<script>`, and safely catch everything the public internet throws back at you — validated, spam-filtered, rate-limited, geo-enriched, stored, and dashboarded.

This is the **FlyRank Internship · Backend Track · Capstone** build. It is an
embeddable widget platform in the same product family as Intercom chat bubbles,
Mailchimp signup forms, and HubSpot lead popovers: a script snippet, a config
endpoint, and a hardened public submission API.

The customer site is just a plain HTML page on a **second local origin** — no
hosting, no domain, no real CDN. The grade lives in the backend.

## The mission

Customers create widgets — signup forms, contact forms, CTA popovers — through an
authenticated API. Each widget gets a one-line `<script>` tag they paste into any
website:

```html
<script src="http://localhost:8000/public/widget/<widget-id>/widget.js?v=<version>" data-widget-id="<widget-id>" defer></script>
```

When a visitor on that external page interacts with the widget, the submission
travels back to the backend, where it is:

1. **Validated at the boundary** — malformed/oversized payloads get clean 4xx JSON errors, never a 500.
2. **Protected against abuse** — 3-tier rate limiting, a honeypot trap, heuristic spam scoring, and fingerprint dedup.
3. **Enriched** — IP → geolocation through a provider fallback chain that degrades gracefully.
4. **Stored** — linked to the right widget and tenant (multi-tenant isolation enforced in every query).
5. **Shown in a dashboard** — counts over time, per-widget stats, geo breakdown, CSV export.

The application receives requests directly from browsers you don't control. That
single fact drives every design decision below: the input can't be trusted, the
traffic can't be controlled, and the origin can't be predicted.

## The five moving parts

Build order mirrors the capstone brief (§4):

| # | Part | Teaches |
|---|------|---------|
| 1 | **Widget management API** — authenticated, tenant-isolated CRUD for widgets (type, fields, button text, display options) | Multi-tenant CRUD + auth |
| 2 | **Embed snippet generation** — the one-line `<script>` that loads the widget bundle | Developer experience |
| 3 | **Fast, cached widget delivery** — versioned JS bundle (1-year immutable cache) + short-lived cached config | HTTP caching + versioned assets |
| 4 | **Public submission endpoint** — CORS (incl. preflight), boundary validation, honest 4xx/429 codes | CORS + boundary validation |
| 5 | **Protection, enrichment & safe side effects** — rate limits, spam controls, geo fallback chain, fail-open webhook | Abuse resistance + graceful degradation |
| 6 | **Owner dashboard API** — submissions, stats, geo breakdown, CSV export | Aggregation queries |

## Architecture

Three request paths, one per actor — keep them separate and the code stays clean:

```
Widget Owner (authenticated)
  └─► Widget Management API ─► Widget DB (tenant-isolated) ─► embed snippet
                            (/widgets CRUD · /widgets/{id}/embed)

Customer Website (any origin)
  └─ <script src=".../public/widget/{id}/widget.js?v=N">   ← one line
      └─► GET /public/widget/{id}/config (public · cached · CORS)
          └─► render widget

Website Visitor
  └─► POST /public/widget/{id}/submit (public · CORS)
      ├─► validation ──────────── bad payload? → 4xx, never 500
      ├─► origin check ────────── mismatched Origin/Referer? → 403
      ├─► rate limit (3 tiers) ── flood? → 429 + Retry-After, service stays up
      ├─► spam control ────────── honeypot · heuristic score · fingerprint dedup
      ├─► store submission ────── linked to widget + tenant
      ├─► geo enrichment ──────── ipapi.co →(fails)→ ipinfo →(fails)→ ip-api →(fails)→ store anyway
      └─► webhook side effect ─── fire-and-forget · fail-open (never blocks success)

Widget Owner (authenticated)
  └─► Dashboard API ◄── submissions + stats + CSV export
      (/widgets/{id}/leads · /widgets/{id}/stats · /widgets/{id}/export · /leads · /leads/stats)
```

The code itself is strictly layered so each concern is isolated and independently
testable:

```
Client
  ↓
FastAPI Router    — HTTP contract: validation, status codes, auth dependencies
  ↓
Service Layer     — business rules: submission pipeline, spam scoring, stats
  ↓
Repository Layer  — data access via Protocol-typed repositories (parameterized SQL)
  ↓
SQLite / PostgreSQL
```

- **Routers** parse requests, enforce auth, and translate HTTP errors — no business logic.
- **Services** hold the business rules (e.g. the lead submission pipeline).
- **Repositories** implement a shared Protocol (`app/repositories/protocol.py`) so the SQLite, PostgreSQL, and in-memory backends are interchangeable without touching upper layers.

## Features

**Widget platform (capstone)**
- Authenticated, tenant-isolated widget CRUD with honest status codes (`201/200/204/404/409/422`)
- Per-widget embed snippet endpoint (`GET /widgets/{id}/embed`)
- Public config endpoint — small JSON payload, `Cache-Control: public, max-age=300`, 5-min Redis cache
- Versioned widget JS bundle — `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`, cache-busted via `?v=` on update
- Public submission endpoint with correct CORS (incl. `OPTIONS` preflight)
- 3-tier rate limiting (per-IP / per-widget-per-IP / per-widget) in a 60s window, `429` + `Retry-After`
- Origin validation against the widget's allowed domain (wildcard `*.` supported, `403` on mismatch)
- Spam controls: honeypot trap, heuristic spam scoring, fingerprint dedup
- IP → geo enrichment with a provider fallback chain (`ipapi.co → ipinfo → ip-api`), async on RQ
- Fail-open, fire-and-forget webhook side effect — a failing webhook never blocks a successful submission
- Owner dashboard API: per-widget + cross-widget lead lists, stats, CSV export, batch delete, re-enrich
- Redis caching for widget config and lead statistics

**Also in this repo (track assignments, background context)**
- Task CRUD with SQLite / PostgreSQL persistence, parameterized queries, one-time seeding
- Supabase JWT authentication (signup, login, logout, protected endpoints)
- Robots.txt-compliant web scraper with rate limiting and retries
- Async AI inference via RQ + Groq, with mock fallback (`GROQ_API_KEY` unset)
- Job lifecycle management (`queued → started → finished/failed`), exponential-backoff retries
- Idempotent job creation via `Idempotency-Key` header (24h TTL)
- Automated PDF report generation (ReportLab, served securely)
- 50 KB request body limit middleware, audit logging of every submission outcome

## Running the Project

### 1. Boot the stack (API + Postgres + Redis)

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This starts PostgreSQL 16 (with `db/init.sql` applied), Redis 7 on host port
`6380`, and the FastAPI app — each with healthchecks. The API is available at
`http://localhost:8000`, interactive Swagger docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

### 2. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Required: SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY (the app refuses to start without them)
```

### 3. Seed demo data

```bash
python -m scripts.seed_demo
```

This requires PostgreSQL, is idempotent, creates a demo tenant, two widgets on
different domains, and sample leads (valid, enriched, spam-flagged, and
honeypot-trapped), then prints the generated `<script>` embed tags and the
dashboard endpoints to hit.

### 4. Serve the "customer site" from a second origin

```bash
python -m http.server 5500 --directory customer-site
```

Open `http://localhost:5500/?widget=<widget-id>` in a browser — the widget loads
from `http://localhost:8000` on a page you didn't build. Submit the form and watch
the lead appear in the dashboard:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/widgets/<widget-id>/stats -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

### Without Docker (dev only)

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

SQLite is the default when no `DATABASE_URL` is set. For the background jobs that
need Redis + a worker:

```bash
docker run -d -p 6380:6379 redis:7-alpine
python -m app.core.worker
```

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/widgets \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Contact Form",
    "domain": "https://myshop.com",
    "config": {
      "button_text": "Get a Quote",
      "brand_color": "#2563eb",
      "fields": ["name", "email", "phone"],
      "success_message": "Thanks! We will be in touch."
    }

# Submit a lead from the second-origin page
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/public/widget/<widget-id>/submit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Origin: https://myshop.com" \
  -d '{"form_data":{"name":"Ana","email":"ana@example.com","phone":"+15551234567"},"referer":"https://myshop.com/"}'

curl http://localhost:8000/widgets/<widget-id>/stats -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
curl http://localhost:8000/widgets/<widget-id>/leads -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

## The submission pipeline (defense in depth)

`POST /public/widget/{id}/submit` runs every submission through the chain:

1. **Widget lookup** — unknown or inactive widgets return `404`.
2. **Origin validation** — the `Origin`/`Referer` host must match the widget's domain (wildcard `*.` supported); mismatches return `403`.
3. **Rate limiting** — three tiers (per-IP, per-widget/IP, per-widget) in a 60s window; excess returns `429` with `Retry-After`. The per-IP identity is the direct TCP peer by default, or the trusted `X-Forwarded-For` client when `TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` is set (see `app/dependencies/client_ip.py`).
4. **Honeypot trap** — a hidden field that bots fill in; it flags the lead as spam (score `1.0`) and skips enrichment/webhooks.
5. **Fingerprint dedup** — identical submissions within the window return the existing lead instead of a duplicate.
6. **Spam scoring** — heuristic scoring (URLs, identical fields, non-ASCII avalanches, disposable email domains, malformed phones).
7. **Storage + async side effects** — the lead is stored, then geo enrichment is enqueued (`enrichment-jobs`) and any configured webhook is dispatched fire-and-forget (fail-open, never blocks success).

## Running Tests

The full suite runs fully offline using in-memory repositories and fake
Redis/RQ (no network, no Docker, no credentials required). Latest recorded CI
result: **962 passed, 100% coverage**.

```bash
pytest
```

With coverage:

```bash
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing
```

Exact CI invocation (from `.github/workflows/ci.yml`):

```bash
python -m pytest \
  tests/embed/ tests/leads/ tests/widgets/ tests/middleware/ tests/models/ \
  tests/repositories/ tests/routers/ tests/scrapers/ tests/services/ \
  tests/test_main.py tests/test_background_jobs.py tests/test_e2e_widget.py \
  tests/test_lead_worker.py tests/test_report_worker.py tests/test_worker.py \
  --ignore=tests/test_e2e.py --ignore=tests/test_ai_e2e.py \
  --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing --tb=short -v
```

The tests cover the scary cases the brief demands: CORS preflight, invalid
payloads (`422`), oversized payloads (`413`), rate-limit bursts (`429` +
`Retry-After`), honeypot/spam blocking, geo provider fallback (A down → B answers;
all down → still `201`), a failing webhook not blocking success, and widget
rendering on a second-origin page (Node DOM/XHR harness). `tests/test_db_schema.py`
needs a live Postgres and the E2E tests need real Supabase/Redis — all excluded
from CI.

Run a single test file:

```bash
pytest tests/routers/test_ai.py -v
```

## Definition of Done

Every box in the capstone brief §6 is ticked, with one pasted proof each in
[`EVIDENCE.md`](EVIDENCE.md). The proofs come from a single offline run of the
exact CI `test:` command in `capstone.yaml` — any evaluator can reproduce them.

The acceptance probes from §12 all pass:
- **Probe 1** — a valid submission from the second-origin page is stored, `2xx`, visible via the dashboard API.
- **Probe 2** — malformed and oversized payloads get clean 4xx JSON errors, never a 500.
- **Probe 3** — a burst of rapid submissions gets `429`s; a normal request right after still succeeds.
- **Probe 4** — geo provider A down → submission enriched by provider B; both down → stored anyway, without geo.
- **Probe 5** — a forced webhook failure still stores the submission and returns success.
- **Probe 6** — a filled honeypot field is silently dropped/rejected.

## Submission pack (GitHub rules §11)

| File | What's in it |
|------|--------------|
| `README.md` | This file — what the system does, architecture, run + seed steps, honest limitations |
| `capstone.yaml` | Machine-readable manifest: `run:` / `seed:` / `test:` / `base_url:` + endpoints to probe |
| `EVIDENCE.md` | One pasted proof per Definition-of-Done checkbox |
| `BUILDLOG.md` | Honest AI-usage log — where AI helped, where it was wrong, what I changed |
| `.env.example` | Every env var with safe placeholder values |

## Design Decisions

- **SQLite by default** — zero-config, file-based persistence for local development; PostgreSQL via `DATABASE_URL` when needed, selected at import time in `app/core/database.py`.
- **Repository pattern** — data access is behind Protocol-typed repositories (`app/repositories/protocol.py`), making SQLite/Postgres/in-memory backends swappable and trivially testable.
- **Parameterized queries** — all SQL uses `?` / `$n` placeholders; user input is never string-interpolated into queries.
- **Boundary validation** — every public payload is validated (Pydantic + manual body parse) before it touches business logic; the server never trusts the client.
- **Fail-open side effects** — enrichment and webhooks run after the row is stored; a dead dependency degrades the response, never destroys it.
- **Versioned delivery** — the JS bundle URL changes on every edit (`?v=` cache-bust), so browsers cache it forever without serving stale code.
- **Async everywhere** — SQLite calls run in a threadpool (`run_in_threadpool`) so the event loop stays responsive.

## Future Improvements

- Email verification flow (currently relies on Supabase's default confirmation settings)
- Real alert delivery — replace the CRITICAL-log stub in `app/services/alert.py` with Slack/email/webhook
- Pagination and cursor-based listing for `/jobs` (currently Redis `SCAN`)
- Webhook retry queue with persistent delivery guarantees
- Postgres as the default configuration with SQLite as the dev fallback
- Persistent `rate_limits` audit table integration (schema exists in `db/init.sql`)
- Circuit breaker around geo providers and per-provider rate-limit budgets

## Limitations

Honest scoping, in the spirit of the capstone brief (§7):

- **Repository layout** — this capstone is developed on a dedicated branch
  (`feature/embed-widget-lead-capture` → `feature/capstone-submission-pack`)
  inside a multi-milestone repo, not in its own standalone
  `flyrank-capstone-widgetplatform` repository. The capstone domain code,
  tests, and submission pack are all present; the separate-repo migration is a
  follow-up.
- **CORS is fully open** — `allow_origins=["*"]`, methods `GET/POST/OPTIONS`.
  Correct for a public widget path; an origin allow-list per tenant would be a
  production hardening step.
- **`POST /widgets` returns `422`** for validation errors (FastAPI default),
  while the original implementation plan specified `400` — resolved with `422` as
  the correct semantic code for schema-validation failures.
- **Rate limits are process-local when Redis is unavailable** — a bounded LRU
  fallback (`app/dependencies/leads.py`), which degrades safely but is not a
  distributed limiter.
- **Email side effect is implemented as a webhook** (the brief allows "a
  confirmation email / webhook"); `dispatch_webhook` is fail-open and
  fire-and-forget, so it can never block a successful submission.
- **Geo enrichment is asynchronous** — the submit response is stored
  immediately; location data is attached by the background enrichment job
  (`enrichment-jobs` queue), so a fresh submission may show as `pending`
  before enrichment completes.
